# Tile Agents
This repo hosts a series of experiments on game-playing LLMs. All games will be tile based, featuring a $n$ by $k$ grid; these types of games are easy to code yet may require diverse strategies to win.

## Connected Components
**Connected Components** is a two-player, turn-based game where players place tiles on a $n$-by-$n$ grid to form connected components. The player with the largest connected component at the end of the game wins.
